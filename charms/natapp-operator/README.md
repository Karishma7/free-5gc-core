# Natapp

## Description

Kubernetes charm to deploy Natapp

## Prerequisite

1. Install Charmcraft

```bash
sudo snap install charmcraft --beta
```

## Usage

### Deploy

To deploy Natapp charm from Charmstore, use the following command

```bash
juju deploy cs:~tataelxsi-charmers/natapp
```

#### Deploy from local repository

To deploy Natapp from local repository, use the following commands

```bash
charmcraft build
juju deploy ./natapp.charm --resource image=tataelxsi5g/natapp:2.0
```

## Developing

Check if the charm is deployed with juju status

## Testing

The Python operator framework includes a very nice harness for testing
operator behaviour without full deployment. Just `run_tests`:

./run_tests
