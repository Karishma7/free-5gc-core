# NSSF

## Description

Kubernetes charm to deploy NSSF core component

## Prerequisite

1. Install Charmcraft

```bash
sudo snap install charmcraft --beta
```

## Usage

### Deploy

To deploy NSSF charm from Charmstore, use the following command

```bash
juju deploy cs:~tataelxsi-charmers/nssf
```

#### Deploy from local repository

To deploy NSSF from local repository, use the following commands

```bash
charmcraft build
juju deploy ./nssf.charm --resource image=tataelxsi5g/nssf:3.0
```

NOTE: NSSF can be deployed only after NRF is up because of
relations configured between the two.

## Developing

Create and activate a virtualenv with the development requirements:

virtualenv -p python3 venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

## Testing

The Python operator framework includes a very nice harness for testing
operator behaviour without full deployment. Just `run_tests`:

./run_tests
