# Create and Onboard 5g-core osm packages

> To create osm vnf and ns packages, use the following commands which will
> generate a vnf package structure named core_vnf and ns package structure
> named core_ns

```bash
osm package-create vnf core
osm package-create ns core
```

> Copy the desriptor into corresponding directory

```bash
cp core_vnfd.yaml core_vnf/
cp core_nsd.yaml core_ns/
```

> To onboard packages into OSM, use the following commands

```bash
osm nfpkg-create core_vnf
osm nspkg-create core_ns
```

> Onboarded packages can be verified with the following commands

```bash
osm nfpkg-list
osm nspkg-list
```

# Adding vim-account and k8scluster to OSM

## Vim-Account

```bash
osm vim-create --name <vim_name> --user <username> --password <password> --auth_url
<openstack-url> --tenant <tenant_name> --account_type openstack
```

vim-create command helps to add vim to OSM where,

* "vim_name" is the name of the vim being created.
* "username"and "password" are the credentials of Openstack.
* "tenant_name" is the tenant to be associated to the user in the Openstack.
* "openstack-url" is the URL of Openstack which will be used as VIM.

## K8sCluster

```bash
osm k8scluster-add --creds <kube.yaml> --version '1.19' --vim <vim_name>
--description "CORE Cluster" --k8s-nets '{"net1": "<network-name>"}' <cluster_name>
```

K8scluster add helps to attach a cluster with OSM which will be used for knf deployment.
where,

* "kube.yaml" is the configuration of microk8s cluster obtained from "microk8s config>kube.yaml".
* "vim_name" is the vim created in the last setup.
* "cluster_name" a unique name to identify your cluster.

Note:[Prerequisites and microk8s setup for 5g-core](../README.md)

# Launching the 5g-core

```bash
osm ns-create --ns_name core --nsd_name core_nsd --vim_account <vim_name>
```

> ns-create will instantiate the 5g-core network service use
> "vim_name" thats added to osm.

## Verifying the services

```bash
osm ns-list
```

> Will display the ns-created with ns-id, with status active and configured
> which means the service is up along with its day1 operations.

```bash
osm ns-show
```

> Will show detailed information of the network service.

```bash
microk8s kubectl get all â€“n core-kdu-<ns-id>
```

> will dispaly all 12 components deployed from bundle in vnfd.

## 5g-core day2 operation

```bash
osm ns-action core --vnf_name 1 --kdu_name core-kdu --action_name
add-user --params '{application-name: mongodb,ue-id: <IMSI_Number> }'
```

* where "core" is the network service name, "1" points to vnf member index
  and "core-kdu" is the kdu name used in package.

* IMSI_Number is the IMSI number of the subscriber to be added in 5G-Core.
  imsi-2089300007487 is an example of IMSI number format.

* "ueid" parameter should hold the desired imsi number.
